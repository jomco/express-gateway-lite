# Lightweight version of ExpressGateway
----

This is a fork of [ExpressGateway](https://github.com/ExpressGateway/express-gateway) trimmed down to the minimal to reduce the amount of dependencies.

Original blurp:

> Express Gateway is a microservices API gateway that sits at the heart of any microservices or serverless architecture, regardless of what language or platform you're using.
>
> Express Gateway secures your microservices and serverless functions and expose them through APIs using Node.js, Express and Express middleware.

---

Removed from original:

- commandline interface
- admin API
- proxy-agent support
- Redis emulation
